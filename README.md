# Simple Digit Recognizer App
### (Uses Flask, JS, OpenCV, ONNX) 

This is the implementation of a Digit Recognizer using Flask as a Web Server.  Just draw the digit and click upload, if you want to start again just do a clear.

### NOTE!
You have to change the *host* and *port*, by default I leave it to 0.0.0.0 and 80 respectively.
